Welcome to **FFusionAI-Streamlit-Playground**, an innovative web application hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**. This project utilizes the power of **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** to create an interactive user interface for exploring and generating images with the **[FFusion AI model](https://huggingface.co/FFusion/FFusion-BaSE)**.

## About the FFusion AI Model

The FFusion AI model is based on the **Stable Diffusion 2.1** framework and supports various schedulers for different use-cases. It is capable of creating hyperrealistic images from user-provided prompts, showcasing the capabilities of modern AI in the field of creative applications. The model is available at [10.57967/hf/0851](https://huggingface.co/10.57967/hf/0851).

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: The application provides an intuitive interface for users to input their prompts and adjust various parameters.

- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can fine-tune various parameters such as image dimensions, guidance scale, and the number of inference steps.

- **Negative Prompts**: The application supports negative prompts to guide the image generation process away from certain attributes.

- **Unique Filenames**: The generated images are saved with unique filenames to ensure each creation is preserved.

- **Concurrent User Handling**: The application is designed to handle multiple concurrent users, making it a robust solution for public use.

- **Memory Optimization**: The application includes memory optimization features for efficient operation, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started

To start using the application, simply visit our [Hugging Face Spaces page](https://huggingface.co/spaces/FFusion/FFusionAI-Streamlit-Playground). Input your prompt, adjust the parameters as needed, and watch as the FFusion AI model brings your prompt to life!
